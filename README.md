# License Plate Recognition

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **license plate recognition system** focused specifically on Indonesian vehicle plates. It uses YOLO models to detect license plates from images, then applies OCR to extract the characters. The application currently supports **image input only** and does **not support live camera processing yet**.

## 🔥 Key Features
- Detects **Indonesian vehicle license plates**
- OCR extraction for Indonesian-style plate text
- Image-based detection (no camera input yet)
- Flask-based web interface
- Customizable configuration via `config.yaml`

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- Flask
- EasyOCR / alternative OCR engine
- HTML, CSS, JS

## 🔍 Current Limitations
- No real-time camera support
- OCR accuracy depends on image quality
- Only supports Indonesian license plate format

## 🧭 Future Improvements
- Add webcam live detection
- Support plates from other countries
- Improve OCR accuracy
- Add vehicle tracking module
- Docker deployment support
